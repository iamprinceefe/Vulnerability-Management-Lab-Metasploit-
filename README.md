<h1>Vulnerability Management (Metasploit)</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This repository provides a detailed guide on using Metasploit solely for vulnerability scanning and firewall configuration to enhance security. The project involves setting up a series of virtual machines on VMWare Workstation to create a realistic testing environment for identifying and mitigating network vulnerabilities.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nmap</b>
- <b>Firewall</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Metasploit</b> 
- <b>Ubuntu</b>

Made sure my Virtualbox was installed, configured and ready: <br/>

<br />
Downloaded the Metasploit 2 Zip file:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Unzipped the File and installed "Metasploitable.vmdk" in my Virtualbox: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Launched Metasploit and login with the default password:  <br/>

<br />
Confirmed the ip address as my target:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Also confirmed Metasploit performance on web:  <br/>

<br />
Sent a ping request from my Ubuntu to Metasploit:  <br/>

<br />
Conducted a scan of all TCP ports on the host using the -sT parameter in Nmap:  <br/>

<br />
Also conducted a scan of all UDP ports on the host using the -sU parameter in Nma:  <br/>

<br />
As the Metasploit machine is intentionally designed to be vulnerable, my ability to directly address the vulnerabilities or open ports found on the host was restricted. Therefore, I opted to install and enable a firewall as a proactive measure to mitigate these issues:  <br/>
